# DataScienceProject
My project for my data science course CSCI 3302 at the University of Colorado Boulder. Utilizing numpy and pandas python libraries, I extracted song data from Billboard and Spotify to measure frequency of trending genres on the Billboard Hot 100, relationships between public music tastes and Billboard charts, and connections between song metrics and popularity. I then presented my findings in a jupytr notebook with various graphs using the libraries mentioned above. Check out my work in the jon_billboardAnalysis.ipynb file.
